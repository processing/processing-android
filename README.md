Processing for Android
======================

This is the main repository for Processing for Android. It includes the core library inside the core folder, and the mode itself in the root. See the [wiki](https://github.com/processing/processing-android/wiki) for build instructions.

The core and VR libraries are available on JCentral, so they can be easily imported
into Gradle projects:
